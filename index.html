            <h2>About Our Project</h2>
            <p>E Ola Ka ʻĀina is committed to addressing food insecurity in Hawai'i through sustainable practices and cultural preservation. Our mission is to reconnect young Native Hawaiian families with traditional agricultural practices while promoting food sovereignty.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Food insecurity affects 48% of families with children in Hawai'i. Despite the islands' rich agricultural history, over 85% of food is imported, driving up costs and increasing vulnerability. Native Hawaiian families are particularly affected, with food insecurity rates double the national average.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>E Ola Ka ʻĀina provides pre-made meals rooted in traditional Hawaiian ingredients, sourced directly from Native Hawaiian farmers. Each meal comes with educational resources, including recipes, nutritional information, and farmer profiles, empowering families to engage with local agriculture and cultural practices.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>In our first year, we aim to provide 5,000 pre-made meals to Native Hawaiian families, alongside educational resources. Our long-term goal is to reduce food insecurity across the islands and create a self-sustaining agricultural system that empowers both farmers and families.</p>
